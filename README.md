This is my quarter 1 final project (a small simple inventory management system) :)
Using the command "docker build -t your_image_name ." we can make the image for the docker file.
Use the command "docker run -it your_image_name" to run the image in linux terminal.
From here we can access the IMS in linux terminal.
